Bubbly planet Venus starts off New Year

Set down your champagne and gaze west, as the bubbly planet <b>Venus</b> kicks off Sunday night’s first evening of the New Year.
See this splendid planet about 23 degrees above southwestern horizon at sunset. You can’t miss this ultrabright beacon — about negative fourth magnitude — skimming over the treetops. By mid-January, Venus hangs 30 degrees above the horizon at sunset, and the planet sets about 8:10 p.m.
On Jan. 24, a waxing young moon begins to ascend toward Venus in the western heavens. The lunar crescent sneaks closer to alluring Venus on Jan. 25, and by the evening of Jan. 26, the moon has passed by our neighbor planet.
Like a 1950s teenager at a diner, <b>Jupiter</b> loiters in the east-southeast sky at dusk, in the Aries constellation. It’s a negative second magnitude (very bright) object. The waxing gibbous moon approaches this large planet Sunday and snuggles closer Monday evening. By Tuesday, the moon has passed Jupiter, but have no fear, we get an “instant replay” from Jan. 28-31.
Bright enough to see from the light-polluted Washington area, <b>Mars</b> and <b>Saturn</b>, both zero magnitude objects, become the New Year’s late-night revelers. The reddish Mars rises just before midnight now in the east. A few hours later, at 1:30 a.m., the ringed Saturn ascends the east-southeast. By late January, both planets loiter in the Virgo constellation, as Mars will rise about 9 p.m. and Saturn appears just before midnight.
Find fleet <b>Mercury</b> now before sunrise in the southeast, in the constellation <b>Ophiuchus</b>, hugging the horizon.
With hot coffee, toast the Baby 2012 by viewing the <b>Quadrantids</b> meteor shower peak early Wednesday morning. The big, fat moon sets at 3:15 a.m., so very early risers could catch some falling stars between then and sunrise. The International Meteor Organization (<a class="show" href="http://www.imo.net">www.imo.net</a>) says the hourly rate could be 120, but, in all honesty, you’ll be lucky to spot a handful. If you spy them, they appear to emanate from the near the Big Dipper and Little Dipper constellations in the northeast. You might see a few errant Quadrantids up to Jan. 12, according to the IMO.
