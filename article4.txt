Towel draped over his head and shoulders, staring at the ground as he mouthed lyrics to the music blaring from his headphones, <a href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/nba/playerstats.asp?id=4716&team=27" title="stats.washingtonpost.com">John Wall</a> appeared flustered, angry and distant as he sat in the visiting locker room at Bradley Center.
Wall had his worst game of the season — and arguably one of the worst of his young career — as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Washington Wizards</a> lost <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/wizards-vs-bucks-roger-mason-jr-ruled-ineligible-as-washington-falls-in-milwaukee/2011/12/30/gIQAWnicRP_story.html">to the Milwaukee Bucks, 102-81</a>, on Friday and dropped to 0-3. The statistics told one side of the story — <a href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/nba/boxscore.asp?gamecode=2011123015&home=15&vis=27">six points on 1-of-9 shooting</a>, with seven assists and four turnovers — and Wall’s body language told another, as he was unusually disengaged and disconnected, even as his teammates attempted a fourth-quarter rally to cut a 26-point deficit down to single digits.
Afterward, Coach Flip Saunders expressed disappointment in the best player on his roster for failing to fight through a challenging night.
